## Removal Policy

You can and will face the appropriate consequences for any of the following violations:

1. Deliberately sabotaging the project will result in a permanent ban from anything relating to PBP.

2. Breaking any of the regular Discord/Divolt server rules will be followed up with appropriate moderation measures.

3. Within the first month of joining the team you must contribute at least one task from the to-do list. You can work on the task alone or with another staff member, as long as you complete a majority of the work and complete it properly. Taking a break within this time will **not** extend the deadline. New staff members should only apply at a time when they're able to actively contribute to the project.

4. Being inactive for two or more weeks without any explanation will result in your removal from the team. After one week of inactivity you'll be given a warning and asked to explain the reason for your absence. If you still haven't explained the reason for your absence after two weeks of inactivity you'll be removed from the team and be given the Contributor role in the Discord server as long as you've made a contribution while on the team. You may re-apply for the position your originally applied for but you won't start out with your previous roles or permissions and you'll have to work your way up to a higher position regardless of whether you had it before. **In order to avoid being removed from the team due to inactivity, please inform a Project Manager of how long you'll be inactive for if possible and explain why. We understand you have a life and may need to take a break, but please have the courtesy to inform the team instead of disappearing without a word.**
