## Release Policy

Each release should be created as fast and efficiently as possible while also making sure the release isn't rushed, has been properly tested and reviewed, and brings forth a noticeably improved version of PBP.

In order for a new public release to be approved, several requirements must be fulfilled:

1. There will be a list of general goals for each new release and they must all be properly implemented, tested, and reviewed before a new release can be created. The only exception to this would be in the case of a specific goal(s) being excluded or postponed due to complications.

2. Once all release goals are met, a Lead Developer may initiate the release process by sending the executable for the release to a Project Manager so they can ensure everything is in order and give their approval.

3. The release must be created at a time when there are multiple Senior Developers and/or Lead Developers online in order to handle any potential issues or complaints pertaining to the release.

4. The release version number must be correct in order avoid any confusion.

Once the release is created, any feedback given by users should be taken into consideration for future releases. If any app-breaking bugs are found, a follow-up release to fix said issue(s) as soon as possible.
