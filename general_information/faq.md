## Frequently Asked Questions

## **1.** Why can't PBP be offically advertised as a piracy app?

PBP was originally planned to serve as a library system for pirated games. However, due to legal concerns, it cannot be officially advertised as a piracy app. If it were to be advertised as such it could become a target for DMCA strikes and lawsuits. The Discord server would also likely be terminated, causing significant communication issues between the development team and the community. Thus, to avoid such risks, PBP is not officially marketed as a piracy app.

While these concerns may not currently seem relevant, it's better to be take a proactive approach rather than risking the realization and escalation of these issues. By taking a preventative approach on these issues now, we can ensure a smooth and successful future for PBP.

## **2.** What's the point of implementing plugins?

As PBP cannot be directly associated with or endorse any pirated software [due to legal reasons](#1-why-cant-pbp-be-offically-advertised-as-a-piracy-app), plugins provide a way to work around this issue. Plugins allow users to use PBP for its original purpose while circumventing legal risks, as PBP is not responsible for user-made plugins and the content or features they offer. The downside is this limits the out-of-box functionality of PBP, but efforts are being made to help alleviate this issue.

## **3.** Why are GitHub permission restrictions placed on developers?

GitHub permission restrictions are in place in order to minimize the risk of mistakes being caused by a developer having permissions that require a greater level of knowledge and expertise to properly apply than they currently possess.

Junior Developers are still getting a grasp on the app and its codebase and are more prone to errors when adding or modifying files. To avoid this, their Pull Requests must be reviewed by either a Senior Developer, Lead Developer, or Project Manager and merged by either a Lead Developer or Project Manager.

Senior Developers are able to review and approve PRs because they've demonstrated their experience and expertise with the app's codebase. However, they still cannot merge PRs, as this could cause significant issues when done inappropriately, so PRs can only be merged by Lead Developers or Project Managers.

Lead Developers are allowed to merge PRs as they help to lead the development team and have proven they have immense experience and expertise with the app's codebase and are very trustworthy.

Nobody has permission to commit to the main branch of repositories and only Project Managers have permission to edit repository and organization settings, create repositories, make releases, and so on.

## **4.** Can I contribute to the project by advertising?

Openly advertising PBP as a piracy app not only carries with it innumerable legal complications but also sets a false precedent when it comes to the out-of-box functionality of the app.

You may publicly advertise PBP in any manner you see fit as long as your advertisement material includes no mention of PBP having piracy functionality. As far as advertising PBP's piracy functionality goes, it's better to do so via word-of-mouth methods such as advertising within piracy communities or sharing it with friends who you think may benefit from it.
