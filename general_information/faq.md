## Frequently Asked Questions

## **1.** Why can't PBP be offically advertised as a piracy app?

PBP was originally planned to serve as a library system for pirated games. However, due to legal concerns, it cannot be officially advertised as a piracy app. If it were to be advertised as such it could become a target for DMCA strikes and lawsuits. The Discord server would also likely be terminated, causing significant communication issues between the development team and the community. Thus, to avoid such risks, PBP is not officially marketed as a piracy app.

While these concerns may not currently seem relevant, it's better to be take a proactive approach rather than risking the realization and escalation of these issues. By taking a preventative approach on these issues now, we can ensure a smooth and successful future for PBP.

## **2.** What's the point of implementing plugins?

As PBP cannot be directly associated with or endorse any pirated software [due to legal reasons](#1-why-cant-pbp-be-offically-advertised-as-a-piracy-app), plugins provide a way to work around this issue. Plugins allow users to use PBP for its original purpose while circumventing legal risks, as PBP is not responsible for user-made plugins and the content or features they offer. The downside is this limits the out-of-box functionality of PBP, but efforts are being made to help alleviate this issue.
