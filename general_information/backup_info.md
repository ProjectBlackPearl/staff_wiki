## Backup Information
 
Despite the server and project itself being legally sound, there is always the possibility of the Discord server being terminated. To help alleviate the potential harm this would have on the project and its community, we've made a backup server on Divolt. Divolt is a version of Revolt being hosted on private servers, which makes it an ideal platform to use for a backup server, as there's no risk of our server there being terminated.

However, in order to lessen the impact this would have on accesibility and ease-of-use for the development team and community, a private backup server has also been created on Discord. All messages sent in the Discord server are cloned in the Divolt server and vice versa. **The backup Discord server is only to be shared with trusted community members and members of the development team.**
